My contribution to the Realty_bds project during internship at T4Tek

Realty.my_profile:
-  controllers: adding request.env.user into the "/my/home" route to get the user's information, adding a dialog flag to trigger the dialog whenever the user successfully changed the password in "/my/security"
-  static/my_profile: adding style.css for tailwindcss design, notify.js for registering and using the notification service
-  views: Designing overall views of the Profile Page in Odoo
